# Dashboard application

## Prerequisites
- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

## Local development
To run the app locally:
1. Install the .NET Core SDK development certificate so the app will load over HTTPS ([details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio#trust-the-aspnet-core-https-development-certificate-on-windows-and-macos)):
```
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

2. Run the app using the `dotnet run` CLI command:
```
    cd dashboard/app
    dotnet run
```
Alternatively, use the `watch` command to update the app upon file changes:
```
    cd dashboard/app
    dotnet watch run
```

3. Visit https://localhost:5001

## Deployment

The app is deployed from [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/18F/piipan). The [configuration](../.circleci/config.yml) is set to deploy to different environments within Azure depending on the branch that triggers the CircleCI job. The basic deploy process is:

1. Build the app
2. Package app as a zip
3. If on a branch that is associated with a deployment, deploy the zip file to the relevant deployment slot in Azure

### Azure deployment slots

***Note:** the following deployment approach describes `staging` and `develop` branches and deployment slots that are currently only mocked in for the purpose of configuring CircleCI and App Service. Our git workflow excludes those branches for now and only uses the `main` branch and `production` deployment slot.*

The app is configured with three deployment slots when created from the IaC:
- production, the default slot created by App Service (`https://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net/`)
- staging (`https://<app_name>-staging.azurewebsites.net/`)
- develop (`https://<app_name>-develop.azurewebsites.net/`)

The CircleCI configuration associates the following branches with each deployment slot:

| branch | deployment slot |
|---|---|
| `main` | production |
| `staging` | staging |
| `develop` | develop |

A push to any of these branches will be automatically deployed to the associated deployment slot upon a successful build.

### Deployment approach

The app is deployed from CircleCI using the [ZIP deployment method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-zip). The app is first built using `dotnet publish -o <build_directory>` and the output is zipped using `cd <build_directory> && zip -r <build_name>.zip .`. Note: the zip file contains the *contents* of the output directory but not the directory itself.

The zip file is then pushed to Azure:

```
    az webapp deployment source config-zip -g <resource_group> -n <app_name> --slot <deployment_slot_name> --src <path_to_build>.zip
```
